This is an Augmentative and Alternative Communications IM application. The goal is to help people with autism communication with each others.
The code only includes text communication as the requirements for image communications are still being drafted. The code includes both client 
and server. The client is an Android application and the server is done in python and resides in Google App Engine. The messages are stored
in the Google Datastore and exchanges through HTTP.
